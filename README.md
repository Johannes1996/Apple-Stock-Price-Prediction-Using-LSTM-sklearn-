# Apple Stock-Price Prediction Using LSTM (sklearn)

In this Code I am trying to build a Model, which is able to predict the Apple Stock Price. I am retrieving the Price data from Yahoo Finance. Then I ran a simple LSTM model and calculated different indicators like: Momentum, Simple Moving Average (SMA), Return on Capital (ROC) and the relative Strength Index (RSI). I checked their correlation to the price data using a heatmap.
